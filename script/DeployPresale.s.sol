/**
 * @title DeployPresale
 * @author HackChain
 * @notice Deploys ONLY the presale contract, against a HACK token that was already deployed
 * separately.
 * @dev Use this script, not `DeployCore.s.sol`, now that the token is deployed on its own:
 * `DeployCore` creates a brand new `HackToken` as part of the full stack, which would leave the
 * presale pointing at a token nobody else uses.
 *
 * Reads three values from the environment:
 *  - `HACK_TOKEN_ADDRESS`   the already-deployed HACK token
 *  - `PRESALE_CAP`          the cap, in units of 18 decimals (100,000,000 HACK is 1e26)
 *  - `PRESALE_ADMIN_ADDRESS` the multisig that will administer the presale
 *
 * After running this, someone holding `MINTER_ROLE` on the token must mint `PRESALE_CAP` to the
 * address this script prints — the contract cannot pay any claim until that happens.
